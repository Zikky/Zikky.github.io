                <h2>Men's Wearhouse</h2>
                <p>This site's biggest challenge was its large dependency on Dojo/WebSphere. While develping the site for mobile devices, I had to constantly be aware of Dojo's intricate Javascript elements to obtain desired functionality while also attempting to optimize the experience to users. Later, I was also part of the team to develop the matching tablet site. Thanks to having previous experience with the mobile site, I was able to contribute greatly to tablet's development.</p>

                <h2>Bass Pro Shops</h2>
                <p>At Moovweb, I led the development of the mobile site for Bass Pro Shops. This site was particularly challenging not just because of the high volume of traffic, but also because of the many third-party components they have included throughout the site that were not optimal on mobile. Clear and constant communication was vital in learning how each third-party component contributed to the desktop site. This allowed for greater understanding of how to preserve and optimize the desired third-party functionality in the mobile site.</p>

                <h2>Alibris</h2>
                <p>Alibris's biggest challenge, while developing, was the aggressive timetable for finishing the site. While leading the development team, I asked team members to quickly notify me if they needed more assistance or had any questions regarding development. By doing so, I was able to optimize our resources to finish our goals on time.</p>

                <h2>Harbor Freight Tools</h2>
                <p>Harbor Freight Tools was my first solo development project at Moovweb. The site was challenging due to its large size for a solo project.</p>

                <h2>Making Strides Against Breast Cancer</h2>
                <p>Making Strides Against Breast Cancer was a particularly challenging site involving third-party components and iFrames. iFrames can be particularly difficult to have on mobile devices due to how different mobile OSes treat them. </p>

                <h2>Relay For Life</h2>
                <p>Relay For Life was challenging mostly due to cross domain issues. It also had similar challenges as Making Strides Against Breast Cancer since both sites are a part of American Cancer Society. </p>
