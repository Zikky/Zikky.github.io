===============
A repository for all my ideas and tinkering. Hoping to add a little every week!



Todo/Focus/Goals List:
* Let's try to keep it focused on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and maybe IE?
* As long as the browser is webkit, this site should work. 
* If the browser doesn't support specific HTML/CSS be sure to have a notice for users; something along the lines of "please view site on blah for best performance"
